          <p>Dear collegues,</p>

<p>We are glad to address you the first issue of the "4 Strategic minutes", the brand new newsletter of EMEA ID.
Since the merging between the I and I and MERA organisations, we always wanted to do a newsletter to facilitate the circulation of the information and to share best practices. With the Strategic Initiatives, we finally took the opportunity to create it and here it is, the issue number 1. As you can see, it is an "interactive" letter, that means, you can react to the articles and answers polls about subjets adressed in the issue. It is important for us to understand how clear our way of informing is, and for you, it is a great opportunity to ask us details or rate the articles.
So enjoy this first issue and again, don't hesitate to interact with the articles.</p>

        <h2>Strategic Initiatives MERA</h2>
           <p>Dear colleagues,</p>
<p>We are glad to address you the 4 strategic minutes newsletter of EMEA ID.
The crisis has a severe impact on business environment (new business habits, more competitors).  As a result past investments have not generated positive results and Nexans has not been performing well during the last 2 years.</p>
<pre><p class="text-center">We must adapt ourselves</p></pre>
<p>The crisis has also created new opportunities (reconstruction of infrastructures, closed markets now open, emergence of new customers). To regain competitiveness in our new business environment and harvest these new opportunities Nexans has launched actions called strategic initiatives. Within EMEA ID we have 2 strategic initiatives:</p>
<pre><p class="text-center">
<li class="text-center">1.Increase our LV/MV sales in Africa and Middle East</li>
<li class="text-center">2.Grow our Oil and Gas downstream activities in Middle East</li>
</p></pre>
        <img class="text-center graph" src="graph.png" width="500">
<p>Our future, the investments in our factories, our jobs depend on the success of the strategic initiatives. We must meet the goals. Missing them would mean that we can not perform in our new business environment and would jeopardize the future of our organizations.</p>
<pre><p class="text-center">Yes we can !</p></pre>
<p>EMEA ID is putting together a number of action plans to meet our objectives. They involve everyone and contain achievable tasks. We need to execute these tasks timely and report during the business reviews. </p>
<pre><code>
<li class="text-center"> Numerous Oil and Gas opportunities in Middle East</li>
        <li class="text-center">Ongoing electrification programs in Africa and Middle East</li>
        <li class="text-center"> Reinforcement of commercial teams in Africa and Middle East</li>
        <li class="text-center"> New way of managing the business through Project Management</li>
